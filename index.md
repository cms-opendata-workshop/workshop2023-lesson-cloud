This lesson shows how to produce a selection of data of your own starting from CMS open data. We will use "POET", the software that you got familiar with during the workshop. We use a simple example to run some heavy-duty tasks on a public cloud vendor. We are scratching only the surface of the potential of this tool, but this lesson lays a strong foundation for how to run realistic physics analysis in GCP using kubernetes.

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers through the [Mattermost channel for the workshop](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cmsodws2023/channels/cloud-computing-lesson).
